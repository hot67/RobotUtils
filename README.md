# RobotUtils

This is a series of classes written by Team 67 that enhance the functionality of WPILib.

A short list of improvements:
  * AdvancedJoystick (only for xbox controllers):
    * Button press handling
    * Treat triggers like buttons
    * Advanced deadband handling for joysticks that don't zero properly
      * Turn deadband into a quadratic, cubic, or sinuoid ramp
    * Side-conscious trigger handling
    * All indices are wrapped up in nice little enums
  * More to come...
  
  When the library reaches a more complete state, the exact list of added functionality will be put here as well as instructions on how to use this library on the wiki page.
